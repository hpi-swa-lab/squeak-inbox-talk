So how do you explain the concept of a pseudo match? Well, this is special kind of text searcher match, some might call it a hack, that allows UI clients for injecting custom excerpts into the results composed by a TalkTextSearcher - even if these excerpts do no actually match the object being searched. Usually, these clients could just prepend their custom excerpt to the stream emitted by the searcher, but that way they would take the risk to show the beginning of the first text twice (once for the first regular match, once for the prepended text). To solve this problem, they can use a pseudo match instead that will be merged and deduplicated like any other regular match.
