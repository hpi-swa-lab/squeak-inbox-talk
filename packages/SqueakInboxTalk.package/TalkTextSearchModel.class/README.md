I deliver the UI for performing free-text searches and customizing the search parameters by a TalkTextSearcher. I am not a standalone tool but meant to composed into another model. I communicate with my parent model via toolbuilding (#buildWith:) and #modelWakeUp for input as well as observer events for output (see #changed:). Most common observer events are #searchTerm, #hasSearchError, and #selectResult (to navigate to the next/previous match, see #accept:). If an error occurs during the search, I highlight my search bar and provide a convenient #debuggableErrorText that my parent model can display at will.

I also implement the minimal TalkFilter protocol so that clients can use me polymorphically to TalkTextSearcher for some use cases or add to me to a TalkFilterSet.
