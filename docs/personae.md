# Persona Models

## Lea (occasional/one-time contributor)

### Profile

- make little (first-time) contributions
- maybe newbie

### Goals

- watch and discuss own contribution(s)

### Difficulties with status quo

- high entry barrier (find out how to contribute, sign up to mailing list)
- review of own contributions is hard to follow: need to watch entire mailing list, monitor relevant threads manually, or create custom inbox filters

### Requirements

- get easily started
- minimize overhead (don't get overwhelmed by the display of the entire contribution list)
- filter for personal contributions
- read and reply to discussions

## John (more frequent contributor)

### Profile

- engage in particular domains
- beginner or slightly advanced

### Goals

- watch and discuss own contribution(s)
- understand connections between own and foreign contributions
- probably also comment and discuss related contributions to similar code units

### Difficulties with status quo

- review of own contributions is hard to follow: need to watch entire mailing list, monitor relevant threads manually, or create custom inbox filters
- connection to related contributions and conversations is hard to understand/be aware of: need to scan the list manually or make exhaustive use of search functions in order to find them

### Requirements

- filter personal contributions
- filter contributions by unit/domain
- maybe fuzzy "related contributions" list?
- read and reply to discussions

## Nancy (code owner, regular merger)

### Profile

- expert/co-responsibility for particular domains

### Goals

- survey new contributions to these domains
- understand connections between contributions
- review contributions: require changes, reject or merge contributions (possibly modify them before)

### Difficulties with status quo

- contributions pending review are hard to find and survey
- need to switch between multiple tools (mailing list, Monticello browser, SqueakSource web interface) to find, check out, review, and merge/treat contributions

### Requirements

- filter contributions by unit/domain
- filter contributions by approval state
- write replies, comment on code
- checkout, explore, and modify code
- move contribution to trunk or treated inbox (maybe via merge commit)

## Marius (regular merger)

### Profile

- veteran for many domains

### Goals

- housekeep the inbox, batch-process contributions
- review contributions: ask questions, require changes, reject or merge contributions (possibly modify them before)

### Difficulties with status quo

- contributions pending review are hard to find and survey

### Requirements

- filter contributions by unit/domain
- filter contributions by approval state
- write replies, comment on code
- checkout, explore, and modify code
- move contribution to trunk or treated inbox (maybe via merge commit)

## Teresa (observer)

### Profile

- lurker of the inbox

### Goals

- read (maybe watch) particular contributions
- maybe keep visions and philosophies of the system alive
- rarely comment/reject contributions, point to existing concepts and ideas

### Difficulties with status quo

- personal discussions are hard to follow: need to read everything or create custom inbox filters

### Requirements

- view unfiltered contribution list
- filter contributions by personal engagement
- write replies, comment on code
